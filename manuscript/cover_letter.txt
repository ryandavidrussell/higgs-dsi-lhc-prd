Dear Editors,

Please find enclosed our manuscript entitled
“Discrete Scale Invariance in the Higgs Sector: A Multi-Channel Analysis of Phase-Coherent Modulation”
for consideration in Physical Review D.

In this work, we analyze public ATLAS and CMS Run 2 differential Higgs data and report evidence for a small, phase-coherent log-periodic modulation across multiple production and decay channels. Using conservative statistical methods and physically constrained amplitudes, we find a global preference for the signal at the 2.04σ level.

A central focus of the manuscript is the explicit exclusion of alternative explanations based on transient chaos, boundary crises, strange nonchaotic attractors, or extreme-event dynamics. We show that the observed deviation is stationary, sign-reversing, and globally phase-aligned, in contrast to known nonlinear instability mechanisms.

All numerical inputs are drawn from public HEPData records and are fully documented to ensure reproducibility. The accompanying appendices and repository provide detailed robustness checks and theoretical context.

To ensure strict reproducibility and transparency, we have released the full analysis suite—including the hardcoded data arrays, covariance matrices, and the neural network validation scripts—as a permanent digital archive (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17861311). This allows referees to independently verify the statistical significance and the exclusion of chaotic dynamical mechanisms reported in the manuscript.

We believe this work will be of interest to readers concerned with precision Higgs measurements, scale invariance, and the interpretation of subtle deviations in high-energy data.

Sincerely,

Ryan D. Russell
