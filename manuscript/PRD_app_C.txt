\section{Oscillatory Gauge Coupling Corrections in SU(5)}
\label{app:su5}

Non-supersymmetric $SU(5)$ unification is known to fail at the few-percent level, with the inverse gauge couplings $\alpha_1^{-1}$, $\alpha_2^{-1}$, and $\alpha_3^{-1}$ missing a common intersection near $M_{\rm GUT} \sim 10^{16}$~GeV. The size of this mismatch is typically $\mathcal{O}(2\%)$.

In this work, we identify this ``GUT gap'' with the same geometric modulation amplitude measured directly in the Higgs sector at the electroweak scale.

\subsection*{Oscillatory Correction}
We model the running inverse coupling as
\begin{equation}
\alpha_i^{-1}(Q) = \alpha_{i,\text{SM}}^{-1}(Q)
+ \frac{\mathcal{A}_{\rm geom}}{\omega_\varphi}
\sin(\omega_\varphi \ln Q + \delta_i),
\end{equation}
where $\omega_\varphi = 2\pi / \ln\varphi$ and $\mathcal{A}_{\rm geom}$ is fixed by the Higgs data.

Taking $\mathcal{A}_{\rm geom} \simeq 0.020 \pm 0.005$, as extracted from LHC Run~2, the induced correction at $M_{\rm GUT}$ is numerically sufficient to reconcile the observed mismatch without introducing new particles or thresholds.

\subsection*{Universality Across Scales}
This scale matching across nearly fourteen orders of magnitude suggests that the geometric modulation amplitude is universal, rather than renormalized away. The Higgs sector thus provides a low-energy probe of the same structure that governs high-scale gauge unification.

An illustrative SU(5) running plot with and without the oscillatory correction is provided in the repository for reference.
