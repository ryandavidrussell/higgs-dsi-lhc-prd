## Purpose of This Repository

This repository provides full transparency for the analysis reported in the PRD submission.

Specifically, it contains:
- The exact analysis scripts used to generate figures
- Hard-coded numerical inputs extracted from public ATLAS and CMS HEPData tables
- All generated figures appearing in the manuscript
- Full LaTeX source of the manuscript, appendices, and cover letter

The repository is intended for **reproducibility and referee inspection**, not as a software package.

## Data Policy

No proprietary or collaboration-internal data are used.

All numerical inputs were:
- Extracted manually from **public HEPData records**
- Hard-coded deliberately to avoid API dependence
- Fully cited with direct URLs

Readers are encouraged to independently retrieve the original datasets.

## Scope of Analysis

Included Higgs Run-2 channels:
- ATLAS ggF H → WW*
- CMS VBF H → γγ
- ATLAS ggF H → γγ
- ATLAS ggF H → ZZ*

This analysis does **not** claim discovery-level significance and is explicitly falsifiable with Run-3 data.
