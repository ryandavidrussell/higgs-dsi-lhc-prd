# higgs-dsi-lhc-prd

Reproducible analysis code and LaTeX sources for:

> R. D. Russell, **“Discrete Scale Invariance in the Higgs Sector: A Multi-Channel Analysis of Phase-Coherent Modulation”**, submitted to *Physical Review D*.

## Contents

- `analysis/` – Python scripts for the log-periodic Higgs fits and plots.
- `data/` – Documentation of the hard-coded LHC inputs and their HEPData origins.
- `latex/` – PRD manuscript, appendices, theory companion, and cover letter.
- `figures/` – Final figures used in the manuscript (generated by `analysis/`).

## Data Sources (high level)

All numerical inputs are taken from public LHC measurements archived on HEPData:

- ATLAS ggF \(H \to WW^*\): **ins1444991**, Table 3  
- CMS VBF \(H \to \gamma\gamma\): **ins2142341**, Table 3  
- ATLAS ggF \(H \to \gamma\gamma\): **ins1674946**, Table 1  
- ATLAS ggF \(H \to ZZ^*\): **ins1615206**, Table 1  

No unpublished data are used. Values in `analysis/` are copied verbatim from these tables and rescaled only by documented luminosity factors.
